    Loads a genome sequence from a plain text (.txt) file.

    This function reads the entire content of a text file and removes any 
    whitespace or newline characters, returning a continuous DNA string.

    Args:
        filepath (str): Path to the genome file (must be a .txt file containing ACGT characters).

    Returns:
        str: A cleaned DNA sequence as a single string.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified file does not exist.
        ValueError: If the file is empty or contains invalid characters.

    Example:
        >>> genome = load_genome_from_txt("data/ecoli.txt")
        >>> genome[:10]

    Computes the frequency of all k-length substrings (k-mers) in a DNA sequence.

    This function counts how many times each k-mer appears in the input DNA sequence

    k-mer, and the value is the number of occurrences.

    Args:
        Text (str): The DNA sequence to scan.
        k (int): Length of the k-mers to count.

    Returns:
        dict[str, int]: A dictionary mapping each k-mer to its count in the sequence.
